## About me!

I am a highly motivated and ambitious go-getter with excellent communication and team management skills; having the whole range of experience right from requirements gathering to cross-team coordination & interaction, standardization & product delivery. I challenge the status quo & view technology as an enabler/catalyst for business opportunities and lifestyle changes. My hard earned experience gained by serving in multiple positions gives me a valuable insight not only in the market and technology but also into product value creation and customer value perception. I have worked with multicultural & multinational enterprises' as well as startups with different backgrounds & organizational culture and adapt according to the needs of the businesses. I have 15+ years of IT & software experience in complex international and multicultural environments with main focus on system architecture & design, object oriented technologies, open source software, strategic relationship maintenance, customer project setups and delivery.
